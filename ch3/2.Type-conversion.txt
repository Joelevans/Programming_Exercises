To perform an operation on two different data types,
we need to convert both to the same data type.
Type casting can either be implicit or explicit.

----------------------------------------------------------
Implicit type conversion
- when you assign a lower range to a variable with larger
 range.

 Explicit type conversion
 - used whenever there is a possibility of data loss.
 - converting a type with a wider range to type with
    a narrow one.(double to float/long to int)

Forcing Overflow exceptions during casting
- sometimes its convenient instead of getting the wrong
result, when a type overflows during switching from
larger to smaller type,  to get notification of the 
problem.

        double d = 5e9d;
        int i = checked((int)d);


N/B::: conversion to or from string is not possible through
        typecasting
