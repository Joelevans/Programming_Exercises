Arrays can be in different dimensions

Vectors - one dimensional
Matrices - two-dimensional

When you declare an array type variable, it is a ref type. (points to mull in the heap memory)
- memory for the elements is not allocated yet.

The *new* operator is used to allocate memory
int[] myArray = new int[6];
