Integer types represent integer numbers and are sbyte,
byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long and ulong.

sbyte
-8-bit signed integer.
-means that the possible values for it is 2^8 i.e 256 values
that can be both positive and negative.
-The minimum value that can be stored in
sbyte is SByte.MinValue = -128 i.e (-2^7)
-maximum value is SByte.MaxValue = 127 i.e (2^7 - 1)
-default value is 0.

byte
-8bit unsigned integer.
-has 256 values that can only be nonnegative.
-default value is 0.
-minimum value is Byte.MinValue = 0;
-maximum value is Byte.MaxValue = 255 (2^8 -1)

short
-16-bit signed integer,
-minimum value is Int16.MinValue = -32768 (-2^15)
-maximum value is Int16.MaxValue = 32767 (2^15 - 1).
-default value is 0.

ushort
-16-bit unsigned integer.
-minimum value is UInt16.MinValue = 0.
-maximum value is UInt16.MaxValue = 65535 (2^16 -1)
-default value is 0.

int
-32-bit signed integer.
-growth of bits increases the possible values that a type
can store.
-default value is 0.
-minimum value is Int32.MinValue = -2,147,483,648 (-2^31)
-maximum value is Int32.MaxValue = 2,147,483,648 (2^31 -1)

int type is the most often used type in programming
this type is natural for the 32-bit microprocessor and is
sufficiently big for most calculations performed in
everyday life.


uint
-32-bit unsigned integer
-default value is the number 0u or 0U.
-the 'u' indicates that the number is of type uint.
-minimum value is UInt32.MinValue = 0.
-maximum value is UInt32.MaxValue = 4,294,967,295 (2^32 -1)

long
-64-bit signed type
-default value is 0l or 0L
-minimum value is Int64.MinValue = -2^63
-maximum value is Int64.MaxValue = (2^63 -1)

ulong
-biggest Integer type
-64-bit unsigned type
-default value is 0u or 0U
-minimum value is UInt64.MinValue = 0
-maximum value is UInt64.MaxValue = (2^64 -1)
