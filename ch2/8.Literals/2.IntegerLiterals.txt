These are sequences of digits, a sign, suffixes and prefixes.
using prefixes, we can present integers in the program source
in decimal or hexadecimal format.

The following prefixes and suffixes may take part:
-"0x" and "0X" as prefix indicates hexadecimal values,eg
0xAF1
- 'l' and 'L' as suffix indicates long type data, eg 357L.
-'u' or 'U' as suffix indicates uint or ulong data type,eg
112u.

By default, the integer literals are of type int.
