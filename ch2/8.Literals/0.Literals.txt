Primitive types are special data types built into the C#
language.
Their values in the source code of the program are called
literals.

E.g
bool result = true;
char capitalC = 'C';
byte b = 100;
short s = 20000;
int i = 300000;

In the above example, literals are true, 'C', 100, 20000 and
300000. They are variable values set directly in the source
code of the program.
