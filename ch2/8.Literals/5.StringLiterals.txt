sequence of characters enclosed in  double quotation marks.
All the escaping rules in char are also valid for string 
literals.

Strings can be preceded by the @ character that specifies a 
quoted string (verbatim string).
In quoted strings, the rules of escaping are not valid,
i.e the character \ means \ and is not an escaping character.
Only one character needs to be escaped in the quoted strings
-the character " (double-quotes) and it is escaped by repeating 
it "" (double double quotes)
All other characters are treated literally, even the new line.
Quoted strings are often used for the file system paths naming.
