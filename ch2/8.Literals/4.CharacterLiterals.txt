Value of type char can be:
 - 'A'
 - character code e.g '\u0065'
 - an escaping sequence

Escaping sequences
-cannot be represented directly in the source code.
e.g "new line" character.
Here are some of the most frequently used escaping sequences
- \' - single quote.
- \" - double quotes.
- \\ - backslash
- \n - new line
- \t - offset(tab)
- \uXXXX - char specified by its Unicode number e.g \u03A7

the character \ is also called an escaping character because it
allows the display on the screen (or other output device) of
characters that have special meaning or effect and cannot be
represented directly in the source code.
