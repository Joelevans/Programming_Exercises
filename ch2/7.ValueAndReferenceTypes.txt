Data types in c# are of two types
: value 
: reference

Value types
-stored in the program execution stack and directly contain
their value.
-are the primitive numeric types, the character type and the
Boolean type
	:sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, long, ulong, float,
	 double, decimal, char, bool.
-The memory alocated for them is released when the program
exits their range. i.e when the block of code in which they 
are defined completes its execution.

Reference Types
- keep a reference (address) in the program execution stack
and that reference points to the dynamic memory (heap) where
their value is stored.
- The reference is a pointer (address of the memory cell)
indicating the actual location of the value in the heap.
- The reference can only point to objects of the same type
- Reference types allocate and release dynamic memory for 
their creation and garbage collection, when it is no longer
used by the program.
- Since allocation and release of memory is a slow operation,
it can be said that the reference types are slower than the
value types
- Reference data types are allocated and released dynamically
during program execution, their size may not be known in
advance.
-Reference types are all classes, arrays and interfaces such
as the types:object, string, byte[]
