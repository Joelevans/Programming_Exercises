A prime number is any positive integer number, which is not
divisible by any other numbers except 1 and itself.
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not
a product of two smaller natural numbers.
Natual number is an integer greater than 0. They start at 1 
and increment to infinity. AKA counting numbers.

Why do we check up to the square root of a prime number to 
determine if it is prime?
ANS:
If a number is not prime it can be factored into two factors
a and b : n = a * b

a and b can't be both greater than the square root of n,
since then the product a * b would be greater than
sqrt(n) * sqrt(n) = n.
So in any factorization of n, at least one of the factors
must be smaller than the square root of n, and if we can't
find any factors less than or equal to the square root,
n must be a prime.
